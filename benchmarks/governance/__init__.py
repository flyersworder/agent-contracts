"""Governance-focused benchmarks for the Agent Contracts framework.

This module contains benchmarks that test the framework's actual value proposition:
resource governance, predictability, and organizational control.

Unlike the research_agent benchmark (which tested optimization), these benchmarks
test what the framework actually provides:
1. Budget enforcement and compliance
2. Organizational policy enforcement
3. Variance reduction and predictability
